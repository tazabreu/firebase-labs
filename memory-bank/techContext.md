## Updated Workflow Design
- Use Firebase CLI for deployment instead of hosting-specific action
- Deploy all Firebase services (functions, hosting, storage, firestore)
- Maintain environment separation
- Document service account setup process

## ESLint Configuration Requirements

The project is missing the following ESLint configuration files:

1. Primary ESLint configuration file (one of the following):
   - `.eslintrc.js`
   - `.eslintrc.json`
   - `.eslintrc.cjs` (for ES modules projects)
   - `eslint.config.js` (for new flat config format)

2. Optional but recommended:
   - `.eslintignore` to exclude certain files/directories from linting

3. Configuration content needs:
   - TypeScript parser configuration
   - Rules appropriate for TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Environment settings (node, es6, etc.)
   - Plugin configuration for @typescript-eslint

All necessary packages are already installed in package.json:
- eslint
- @eslint/js
- @typescript-eslint/parser
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

## Health Service Enhancement Strategy

### 1. Logging Implementation
- Use Pino as a lightweight, performance-focused logger
- Create a central logger module for consistent usage
- Define standard log levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace)
- Include context data in log entries (request ID, timestamp, service name)

### 2. Info Endpoint Design
- Follow standard metadata patterns from Spring Boot Actuator and similar frameworks
- Include version, environment, uptime, build info
- Structure response for easy consumption by monitoring tools

### 3. Health Check Architecture
- Implement provider pattern for health checks
- Enable async parallel checks with proper timeout handling
- Create a unified health status aggregation mechanism
- Follow industry standards for health status representation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Logging Solution

**Dependencies to add:**
- pino
- pino-pretty (for development)

**Module structure:**
- Create src/utils/logger.ts
- Export configured logger instance
- Support different log levels based on environment

### 2. Info Endpoint

**Implementation:**
- Add route: app.get('/info', ...) in index.ts
- Include metadata:
  - version (from package.json)
  - environment
  - uptime
  - timestamp
  - node version
  - memory usage

### 3. Enhanced Health Check

**Module structure:**
- Create src/health/index.ts - main health check coordinator
- Create src/health/providers/firebase.ts - Firebase service checks
- Create src/health/providers/cat-api.ts - Cat API service check

**Status determination logic:**
- UP: All checks pass
- DEGRADED: Non-critical checks fail (e.g., Cat API)
- DOWN: Critical checks fail (e.g., Firebase)

**Response format:**


## Updated Development Workflow

- Build and serve scripts now run independently in separate terminals
- TypeScript compiler runs in watch mode in one terminal
- Firebase emulator runs in another terminal
- This improves visibility of logs and error messages
- Each process can be restarted independently as needed
