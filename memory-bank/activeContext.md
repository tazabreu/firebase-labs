## ESLint Configuration for this Project

Based on the current setup:

1. TypeScript Configuration:
   - ES2020 target and module format
   - Node.js module resolution
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - Source files in 'src' directory
   - ESM modules format (from package.json)

2. Required ESLint Configuration:
   - Must support ES modules (package.json has "type": "module")
   - Must be compatible with TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json
   - Should focus on linting .ts and .js files as specified in the lint script
   - Should respect the existing code style in the project

3. Implementation Plan:
   - Create .eslintrc.cjs file (using CJS format for ESM projects)
   - Configure TypeScript parser with ES2020 settings
   - Set up recommended rules for both JS and TS
   - Add Firebase-specific rules if needed
